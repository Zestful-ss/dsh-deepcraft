# AGENTS.md

`dsh-deepcraft` is a theme plugin for DeepSeek Harness that replicates the look and interaction of Claude Code Desktop. It is a layer over the host: until the host offers an extension point for something, the effect is made with CSS and DOM overrides in the browser (D43).

The shape of the tree, the two halves and the invariants that cross them are in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). A direction is recorded in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md) as one page: the background it answers, the decision, what follows from it, and what would make it worth revisiting. Read the ones a change touches before making it; the numbers code comments cite are those files' names.

## Writing Rules

- When no comparison is requested, do not use contrast constructions like "not X but Y" or "do X instead of Y".
- Proposals are fully considered and complete in one pass; never phrase work as "first do a version, then observe and adjust". When several proposals are genuinely needed, each stands on its own in parallel; never order them as tiers from conservative to aggressive.
- Do not enumerate or report results that were ruled out during searching and troubleshooting.
- Answers have no preamble and no summary.
- Code identifiers keep their original English names; never invent abbreviations; describe concrete operations with complete verb–object phrasing.
- A reply written in Chinese uses full words of two or more characters (崩溃, 终止, 判定, 推断, 抛出, 挂起, 卡死), never single-character abbreviations; jargon like 「落地」「钉死」「对齐」「栈」 is banned.

## Behavioral Red Lines

- Import needed libraries directly; never guard imports with try/catch. The one exception is the host half's guarded schemastery import in `packages/host/src/settings.ts`, its reason beside it; any new exception carries its reason beside the import the same way (D12).
- Never enter plan mode on your own initiative.
- Never use Git to roll back code. "Roll back" from the user always means restoring the previous state by hand with the edit tools.
- Never read from or write to the system temp directory; intermediate artifacts go to `.debug/` (gitignored).
- When the user provides a web link, read its full content before starting; when a library turns out to be used wrongly, re-read that link in full first.
- Do not reinvent a wheel to avoid a dependency. The package has zero *runtime* dependencies: React and the host packages come from the host at runtime (D36).
- Fail fast: throw where the error is, never swallow it, never fall back silently. A catch is allowed only where it isolates one failure from the rest or where the comment beside it states why the error may stop there (D12).
- No mocks, no fake implementations, no workarounds that exist only to make tests pass.
- The user may withdraw or modify your changes at any time: re-read a file before continuing to edit it, build on the latest state, never re-add what the user deleted.
- If the user asks about something else mid-task, answer at once if you can, then resume the original task; never leave a task half-done.
- When fixing an error in documentation or code, leave no trace of the error.
- Every feature is implemented and iterated until it works; never stop after a first version and ask the user to test. Whether it works is settled by the pushed commit's cloud run, and a gate on this machine starts only in the stretch before a push, over the change that push carries: one run through `npm run verify`, a bare request while the change in hand is narrow and `--full` when the push needs the browser walks judged (D66).
- Never inline long multi-line scripts on the command line; write the script to `.debug/` and run it.
- Authored changes — new logic, copy, rules — go through the edit tools. Mechanical transformations across files (moving, renaming, rewriting paths, migrating syntax) may be scripted: the script lives in `.debug/`, its whole diff is read afterwards and the gates are passed; the script never writes new logic.
- Never hand-write a parser for a mature file format; use a library, or avoid parsing.
- A user message ending in a question mark is a question: answer only the question; no better approach, no counter-question, no "ready when you are".
- After the user points out a mistake, continue from the premise that the spot is wrong; do not restate why.
- Output stays in a clean final state: replies, code, comments and commit messages carry no trace of earlier mistakes or of the correction process.
- Conflict priority: the user's current instruction > current repository code > this file > `docs/`. Whether a convention overturned by a current instruction is written back into the documents is the user's call.

## Principles

- Read the ADRs a structural change touches before making it; never contradict one. A direction is overturned by writing the replacing ADR first, naming the numbers it replaces (D48).
- A change earns an ADR only by D48's threshold: one-time moves go to `docs/changes/` and the commit message, tool-enforceable rules go to lint or the build checks, and an ADR constrains future changes with reasoning the code and tests cannot carry. An ADR keeps its own number for good: the number is the handle code comments cite, a replaced one is recorded as void on the replacing ADR's 取代 line, and amendments are never stacked as separate files.
- Public documentation (the bilingual READMEs, the CHANGELOG) never shows decision numbers.
- The Anthropic Sans/Serif/Mono fonts are Anthropic's, for personal use, not covered by MIT, and never shipped in the npm package; `packages/assets/src/fonts/anthropic/` is a repository-only download, and a user's own copy is served from `$DSH_HOME/dsh-deepcraft/fonts/`. JetBrains Mono, Inter and Noto Serif ship under the SIL OFL 1.1. The pixel crab is Anthropic's character and its sheets are not covered by MIT. Deepy's sheets are by calmly-eating-bugs (@wp3171216237); `docs/gifs/` holds that author's GIFs and stays out of the package.
- Local debug scripts, screenshots and intermediate artifacts go into `.debug/` and are never committed. Drafts are deleted when the task ends; a probe worth keeping becomes a scenario in `packages/testing/scenarios.cjs` (D66).

## Stop Lines

Hard stops: stop the moment one triggers, without first judging whether it is worth it.

- A source file approaching 750 lines: stop adding features to it and propose splitting it by responsibility inside its feature directory; wait for the user's confirmation, and until then the file gets bug fixes only. `npm run lint` fails when a file crosses the line, and the one file it lets past records the size it stood at.
- The same host query or the same pattern appearing a 2nd time: stop and move it into the shared layer (host accessors into the host access module). `npm run lint` scans for copied stretches and fails on any of them, so a second copy is the last one.

## Conventions

### CSS

- Stylesheets are plain CSS: attributes are spelled out, and a brand mark is read as `var(--dsh-deepcraft-image-<name>)`. The build checks scope, the composer gate, `:has()` placement, the token gates and that every `data-dsh-*` attribute a selector reads is written somewhere in the TypeScript, on the syntax tree (D9). Dark tokens are the base, light overrides go under `:not([data-ds-dark-theme])`. Light canvas `#FCFCFB`, dark `#141413`, accent ember orange `#D97757`; no pure white, pure black or cold grays.
- `!important` only where the page needs it: over a host `!important`, an inline style or another skin rule. The lane's `importance` scenario drops each one on the real page and fails on any that changes nothing (D9); run it after writing one.
- Token values and host aliases live in `packages/client/src/theme/tokens.json`; the token stylesheet and the token, motion and layer tables in `docs/STYLE.md` are generated from it. A time, an easing curve (D9) and a z-index above 9 (D9) are read from it, never written.
- A feature never borrows another feature's class names; shared looks use the neutral shared classes (`dsh-deepcraft-popover-card`, `dsh-deepcraft-popover-item`, …).
- Design tokens and shape rules are in `docs/STYLE.md`; read it before changing visuals.

### Host Selectors

Read D3 before adding a host selector. After adding a substring selector, compare what it matches on a live page. A new selector goes into `packages/contracts/src/dom.ts` with an entry in `packages/contracts/src/table.ts` (its id, what it means, how the contract test checks it) and that id in the `contracts` list of every feature manifest that reads it; the build refuses a literal without a table entry and an entry no manifest claims.

### Comments

Comments carry only what a reader needs to keep the code correct: why the code has this shape, the host contract it depends on, the ordering that matters, what breaks if it changes. One to three lines is the norm. Never restate the code, narrate the change, or record measurements or release history. A direction with reasoning behind it lives in `docs/adr/`; cite the file's number (`D9`) and let the comment carry only what the code needs. Visual rules cite `docs/STYLE.md`.

### Model Copy

Read D5 before editing `packages/client/data/model-descriptions.json`.

### Screenshots and Privacy

Before writing to disk, `scripts/shared/privacy.cjs` replaces workspace names, session titles, usernames, drive-letter paths and balances with neutral stand-ins and runs a leak scan; a failed scan fails the run and is never bypassed. `shoot.cjs` and the end-to-end lane's `shots` scenario both go through it, and each writes its captures to the run's output directory for review. The conversation scene opens the sidebar conversation titled `Markdown rendering tour` and refuses one holding any user message other than the demo prompt in `packages/testing/shoot.cjs`.

## Layout

The tree's shape, the two halves and what each holds are in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). The rules that follow from it: `locale/<language>.json` is plugin metadata, and `package.json`'s `exports` must cover it with `"./locale/*"`, or the host degrades the whole metadata (icon included) to `meta.error`; a new handle goes into `Handles` in `core/scheduler.ts`, and lint refuses a feature module importing the whole `Ui`; a stylesheet that belongs to no feature goes into `THEME_SHEETS` in `scripts/build.mjs`; a non-null assertion `!` only marks a value the call order guarantees; the mechanism that only talks to the host page goes into `packages/engine/`, and it reads the skin's own vocabulary through the seam its entry hands over rather than importing the skin (D73) — a host service is read through an accessor in `packages/engine/src/host.ts`, never by name at the feature.

## Commands

Each script states its own purpose at the top of the script; the table below is written by `npm run agents`, and the runs that take flags or drive a live page follow it.

<!-- commands:start — written by npm run agents, not by hand -->

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | the dev dependencies: TypeScript, esbuild, Ajv, Vitest, Playwright and the React types |
| `npm run build` | bundle `lib/client.js` from the TypeScript modules and stylesheets in `packages/client/src/` |
| `npm run dev` | rebuild on every change to what the build reads |
| `npm run changelog` | assemble CHANGELOG.md's [Unreleased] section from docs/changes/ |
| `npm run changelog:check` | fail when the committed `[Unreleased]` section differs from `docs/changes/`; the cloud job runs this |
| `npm run docs:index` | write docs/adr/README.md from the ADR files themselves |
| `npm run docs:check` | fail when the committed ADR index differs from the ADR files; the cloud job runs this |
| `npm run checks:numbers` | every number a check decides on, as a generated record |
| `npm run agents` | write this table into AGENTS.md from `package.json` and each script's own header |
| `npm run agents:check` | fail when AGENTS.md's command table differs from `package.json`; the cloud job runs this |
| `npm run lint` | the rules that need no build |
| `npm run probe` | headless UI regression probe for the composer invariants |
| `npm run smoke` | zero-dependency smoke test of the BUILT plugin (`lib/`); no running DSH instance is needed |
| `npm test` | the unit lane on its own, as the cloud job runs it: Vitest in browser mode on the local Chrome or Edge |
| `npm run verify` | the one entry a test run goes through |

<!-- commands:end -->

```

Every test run goes through `npm run verify` (D66), and a run belongs to the stretch before a push. `node scripts/verify.mjs --help` prints the tiers and what each one walks; the lock the lanes share and the verdict cache are described at the top of `scripts/verify.mjs`. The quick tier leaves out the motion cases; a feature whose cases all watch motion is covered by naming it (`--feature <dir>`), which drops the quick tier. A lane that reads frames — the smoke's motion cases, the end-to-end scenarios that sample the page — is what a loaded machine disturbs: both lanes take `--jobs <n>` (default from the machine's core count) and `--jobs 1` drives one page or scenario at a time. probe, probe-timing and shoot need a running `dsh web` (default `http://127.0.0.1:3080`, `--url` for another; the token is the `/?token=…` in the GUI URL or `DSH_WEB_TOKEN`). All of them need a local Chrome/Edge (`CHROME_PATH` to choose one). `packages/testing/e2e.cjs` boots its own host and needs no running instance, and gives a verdict only on the newest host version published under any dist-tag (`packages/testing/host-version.cjs` reads it from the registry; a machine with another one gets exit 3 and `verify` answers `UNJUDGED`); its scenarios and their scripts are in `packages/testing/scenarios.cjs`, and the bounds its checks read are in `packages/testing/bounds.json`.

### Live Inspection

- Desktop window: `node D:\DSH\dsh-desktop-bridge\bin\bridge.cjs "<expression>"` evaluates in the window the user sees (`--stdin` reads a script file). While that window is in the background its animation frames are paused: a probe waiting on `requestAnimationFrame` hangs, and anything it put in the page must be cleaned up by hand.
- Which build a page runs: `document.body.getAttribute('data-dsh-deepcraft')`; `npm run build` prints the id it wrote. Hot reload swaps the bundle without reloading the page; reload a page that went through many hot reloads before treating it as evidence.
- Host sources: the globally installed `@deepseek-ai/dsh` carries the host's client packages under `node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-*/lib/`; the desktop's own copies are fetched from the `url` of each entry in the page's `__DSH_BOOT__.entries`.
- A scratch worktree under `.debug/` that borrows this tree's `node_modules` through a directory link is taken off with `node scripts/worktree.mjs remove .debug/<name>`: `git worktree remove` follows the link on Windows and deletes the directory it names, which for `node_modules` is the main tree's own.
- A scratch `dsh web` that has `@alm-allen/dsh-chat-ux` installed makes the skin's chat features stand down; to match a profile without it, filter that entry out of both `__DSH_BOOT__.entries` and every `batches[].entries` before the page boots. A scratch instance on a real model creates real sessions and usage when a message is sent.

## Change Workflow

0. Change `packages/client/src/` or `packages/host/src/`; never touch `lib/`.
1. `npm run build`, or keep `npm run dev` running while iterating.
2. While iterating, the build and the live page carry the work forward (D66): a bare `npm run verify` answers in seconds what the change in hand reached and starts no browser. The push is covered by one run, started in the background before it, and the tier that run takes is named by what needs judging (`node scripts/verify.mjs --help`). Compare the tree hash the run prints with the tree in hand. Skipping the run and letting the cloud answer in its place pays a full cloud round trip plus a re-push when the run comes back red. The live checks belong to that same stretch: with a `dsh web` running, `probe.cjs`, and the live page itself, including after a hot reload. Timing and ordering against the real host are settled on a real instance — the smoke stand-in does not reproduce them — and the end-to-end lane is where that judgement happens.
3. Visual changes are checked by the user in light and dark; re-shoot stale README screenshots with `shoot.cjs`; `packages/testing/e2e.cjs --scenario shots` writes both palettes to the trace directory for that review, with the privacy sweep already applied.
4. Sync documents: the bilingual READMEs and the documents beside them change together; a behavior change adds one file under `docs/changes/` (D48) and `npm run changelog` writes the `[Unreleased]` section from those files — never edit that section by hand; a changed direction becomes its own page under `docs/adr/` following D48, and the index is regenerated with `npm run docs:index`.
5. Done means the pushed commit's cloud run passes — the cloud runs on a push to master, a pull request, a merge-queue entry or a manual run — and the behavior is verified there. The branch rule names the single `required` job, so a merge waits on every job of that run while the jobs themselves stay free to change. The full smoke is the release gate and runs in the cloud; a run on this machine happens only in the stretch before a push (step 2).
6. A cloud failure is owned by the push that carried it: a red run on master over the commits this session pushed is this session's to fix and re-push; a failure on another branch, on someone else's merge or on an external pull request is reported to the user, not fixed here.

## Git and Release

- Conventional commit prefixes (`fix(scope):`, `refactor(scope):`, `docs(scope):`, `chore(release):` …); commit titles and bodies in Chinese; one logical change per commit, no WIP, no unrelated changes; moves are committed apart from logic changes.
- Several sessions work in the main tree at once, so a commit carries one session's change: stage the files of the change in hand and leave the rest uncommitted. A pull request to an outside project is the one branch of a session's own that gets pushed.
- `lib/` is build output and never committed (D47): it is gitignored on `master`, built by the gates, and shipped on the `dist` branch.
- Release: `node scripts/changelog.mjs --release <version>` (the pending changes become that version's section and `docs/changes/` is cleared) → `npm version patch|minor` → commit the two and push the tag. The local machine runs no gate and no build for the release: the workflow builds and packs. The Release workflow runs the gates and the end-to-end lane, writes `dist` with the package's own files and moves the version tag onto that packaged commit, and opens the GitHub Release with the version's CHANGELOG section (`node scripts/changelog.mjs --notes <version>`); a rerun writes the same files again. The repository is distributed through the `dist` branch (the default branch, which a `dsh plugin add <repository>` install reads) and is not published to npm, so a push to npm is not part of a release. `scripts/dist-branch.mjs --push` does the `dist` step by hand if needed (it builds first, since `lib/` is not in version control).
- CHANGELOG format (the `[Unreleased]` section and the release sections are written by `scripts/changelog.mjs`; the files under `docs/changes/` are what is authored):
  - Version sections `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, newest first; work in progress under `## [Unreleased]`.
  - Each section bilingual on one page: a `[中文](#cn-x.y.z) | [English](#en-x.y.z)` line, then `<h3 id="cn-x.y.z">新增功能</h3>` and `<h3 id="en-x.y.z">New Features</h3>` anchors carrying the version; further groups use plain `###`.
  - Groups, fixed in name and order: 新增功能 / 体验优化 / 问题修复 / 安全 / 移除 / 其他变更 and New Features / Improvements / Bug Fixes / Security / Removals / Chores; empty groups are omitted.
  - Footer: `Full Changelog: [vPrevious...vCurrent](compare link)`.
  - One entry per verifiable behavior or contract, as one sentence in each language: verb-first (新增、修复、改善 / Add, Fix, Improve), no bold, no `标题：说明` split, no account of how the code worked before, no measured numbers, no attribution — those belong in the commit message. Proper nouns, option names, flags, file paths and code stay verbatim; an external contract change names the migration in the same sentence; user-facing changes stay in sync with the READMEs. No internal numbering, no boilerplate, no format notes inside version sections.
