/**
 * The conversation view-tab strip's vertical placement — measured, not guessed.
 *
 * The strip's own row sits below the header's title row, and that title row
 * ALSO carries the header actions (the background-task chip, the workspace /
 * preset picker, the overflow menu, the panel toggle). Whether the strip can
 * rise onto the title's line therefore depends on the window: centred, it fits
 * beside a short title on a wide header and collides with the actions on a
 * narrow one, so a fixed offset cannot be right in both cases.
 *
 * So the skin measures the boxes and writes ONE custom property,
 * `--dsh-view-tabs-shift`, which the stylesheet turns into the translate. The
 * stylesheet keeps the fallback (its own row); this only lifts the strip when
 * the room above is real — the title and the actions both clear it, and the
 * header's top inset still holds.
 *
 * Windows titlebar mode is the one case where no measurement is needed: the
 * desktop shell marks <html> with `data-windows-titlebar` and the strip is
 * placed fixed in the titlebar row, centred (view-tabs.css). This mirrors that
 * marker onto the header holding the strip so the stylesheet can switch, and
 * skips the measured shift entirely there.
 *
 * macOS keeps the measured path. Its shell hands the top of the window to
 * the traffic lights and pads no content around them: the host sets
 * `--dsh-frame-top-clearance: 48px` under `html[data-platform=darwin]` and
 * leaves `--dsh-frame-chrome-top` at 0, so the conversation header keeps its
 * own top inset and draws its first row inside that strip. A fixed strip
 * would land on the title and the header actions; the measured shift already
 * seats it on the row beneath the strip.
 *
 * The strip itself is stamped `data-dsh-view-tabs`, and every strip rule in
 * view-tabs.css keys on that attribute. Finding the strip is a query this pass
 * runs once; as a stylesheet selector (`header:has(tabs) tabs`) it would make
 * the browser re-match the whole document on every DOM change.
 *
 * The strip's active pill slides between tabs (packages/client/src/shared/sliding-pill.ts).
