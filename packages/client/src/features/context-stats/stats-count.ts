/**
 * The session's figures counting to their new readings.
 *
 * The line carries its figures as plain text (inline-stats.ts), so a reading
 * that moves rewrites the same words in place: the values the reader sees travel
 * toward the newest reading rather than landing on it.
 *
 * The motion is a chase: each frame closes a share of the distance still left,
 * sized so a reading that stops moving is reached within the duration token
 * (D9). A reading that changes again on the next frame is simply a new target,
 * and the frame loop keeps its own place — a clock restarted per reading never
 * gets going while the readings pour in, and a fixed end stutters each time the
 * target moves. The figures stop within half a unit of the reading, which is
 * where every formatter on the line rounds to it.
 *
 * A reading that arrives while reduced motion is chosen is written as it is, and
 * so is one whose projection has no figure before it to count from. The frame
 * loop runs on the engine's frame pipeline (D40).
