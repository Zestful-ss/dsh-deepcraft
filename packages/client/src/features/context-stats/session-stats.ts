/**
 * The session's numbers, read from the host's own projections
 *
 * Where they show follows the `statsPosition` choice: `context` hides the
 * composer's statistics row and moves the numbers into the popover the context
 * meter owns (features/composer/inline-bar.css), while `inline` leaves the host
 * row hidden too and writes them onto a line of its own under the card, with
 * the meter at that line's end. The choice is read on every pass, so switching
 * it moves the numbers without a reload. The panel carries the rows in both
 * positions: with the numbers on their own line, that line is the panel's
 * second trigger, so the figures expand into the rows a reader asks for.
 *
 * They are read as DATA: the host computes `sessionStats` and `tokenUsage` as
 * durable whole-log session projections, and the session face carries their
 * key-addressed read faces (`session.projections.faceOf`) — the same seat the
 * host's own `useProjection` resolves. The host's two stat dialogs are never
 * opened, so nothing is rendered twice, and both surfaces are filled the moment
 * they appear (and again on every projection frame). The written-back figure
 * carries an estimate of the text streaming now (stream-estimate.ts): the host
 * settles a step's usage at its end, so without it that figure would stand
 * still through the answer.
 *
 * The WORDS come from the host's own `chat` locale namespace, the one its
 * pills read, so the three surfaces agree letter for letter and follow the
 * shell language together; the formatting rules the host applies before it
 * paints are mirrored in stats-format.ts. The meter's own reading takes the
 * occupancy colour band (stats-ramp.ts).
 *
 * The projections are followed here, the rows and sections are built in
 * stats-model.ts, the host's panel and its marks are read in stats-panel.ts,
 * the popover block is written in stats-block.ts, the line of its own in
 * inline-stats.ts, and the hover path and the alignment reading are in
 * stats-binding.ts.
 *
 * @param ctx - client context: the session binding and the locale seat.
 * @returns { measure, sync, close, reposition, teardown }.
