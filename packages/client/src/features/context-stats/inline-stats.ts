 * The session's numbers on a line of their own under the composer, for the

 * the host's own figures, none of the host's row's glyphs, and the context meter
 * the host draws at that line's end. The figures are plain text, and a reading
 * that moves counts to its new value (stats-count.ts): while an answer streams
 * the readings arrive back to back, and an entrance on every one would churn
 * the line for numbers that barely moved. The cache share's figure and the
 * percent sign after it take the colour band the ramp names while the label
 * before them keeps the line's own tone.
 *
 * The host's statistics row stays in the document, hidden, because the panel
 * reads the 「性能与用量」 level off its structure. The words come from the
 * host's own `chat` templates with each number swapped for a marker, so every
 * number stays its own figure. A line too wide for its card drops figures one
 * step at a time and never changes height, or the conversation above it would
 * jump with every step.
 *
 * The contract is the host's projection keys, `chat` keys and the statistics
 * row's structure: a host that reshapes the row leaves the figures absent
 * without an error. A host panel or slot for these figures retires this line.
