 * The tokens a streaming answer has added so far, as an estimate.
 *
 * The host settles its usage a step at a time (`tokenUsage` moves on
 * `assistant/message`), so the written-back figure would stand still while the
 * answer streams and jump once when the step ends. The text the host streams is
 * on the page: counting the characters the streaming containers have grown by
 * is enough to let the figure move, and the settlement replaces the estimate
 * with the provider's own number.
 *
 * The page's text is thinner than what the provider bills: a tool call's
 * arguments are not on the page as text at all, and the renderer drops the
 * markers it parses. So each call row of the step counts `CALL_TOKENS` beside
 * the text — a wide (CJK) character at `WIDE_TOKENS`, everything else at
 * `NARROW_TOKENS` — and the figure is corrected as soon as the step's usage
 * lands, so only the written-back side rides on them: a request's prompt is
 * fixed while it streams. The counts are read off the structure bus, not per
 * frame, and the readings stay on the interval above.
