/**
 * The waiting line's loader carries three motions at once, one lane each, and
 * this is the state machine that rotates them (chat-wait.css holds the lanes,
 * their motions, and what each motion's own moments are).
 *
 * The loader opens on the snippet's bouncing dots and then, every
 * `--dsh-deepcraft-period-dot-rotate`, hands the row over to another of the three
 * — a motion never follows itself, so the turn is always a visible change: the
 * hopping dots, the dots walking three lines through one point, and the four
 * dots swapping the corners of a 45 : 55 rectangle.
 *
 * A change is a hand-over and never a cut: the lane leaving fades each of its
 * dots out over one of its own legs, starting where that motion next turns back
 * — off the floor for a bounce, off an end for a walk, wherever it stands for
 * the swap, whose own cycle is the only thing that carries it out to a corner —
 * and once its last dot has gone, the lane arriving comes into the page and
 * fades each of its dots in over one of its own legs, starting where that motion
 * next carries it, so the box never draws two motions at once. No dot is ever
 * moved to a pose its motion does not carry, and no dot leaves or arrives at a
 * moment its own motion did not choose.
 *
 * Under the Reduced animation choice (D40) a change lands at once, with no fade:
 * each lane holds the frame its own motion stands on.
