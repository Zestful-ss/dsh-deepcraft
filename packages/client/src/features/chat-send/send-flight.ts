 * The send bubble's take-off, ported from dsh-chat-ux.

 * After a submission the host mounts an echo bubble at once and swaps it for

 * the real row takes over a second. An animation hung on either node is dead on
 * arrival (on the echo it loses its node midway; waiting for the real row leaves
 * a second of nothing), so this draws a stand-in of its own: a copy of the
 * composer card lifts off and narrows into the bubble as it travels. How the
 * stand-in is built and how the shape is worked out is in send-morph.ts; this
 * module decides when it takes off, where it flies and when it lands.
 *
 *   capture   the submission's capture phase takes the whole composer card
 *             (clone, geometry, looks), all before React clears the draft.
 *   notice    the echo row is noticed the moment it mounts, through a
 *             MutationObserver rather than a per-frame poll.
 *   launch    the stand-in goes on the page and the whole animation goes to
 *             the compositor; the real row is marked and hidden (keeping its
 *             layout box, so the destination can be measured every frame).
 *   per frame exactly two things: how far the destination moved (the host
 *             scrolling to the end, the echo becoming the real row) is added to
 *             the stand-in's outer layer; and once the shape's stretch is over,
 *             the shell is normalised (see send-morph.ts's compact). Position,
 *             shape, colour and the words' re-flow are all on the compositor,
 *             so they keep moving while the host parses a response on the main
 *             thread.
 *   land      unmark the real row and fade the stand-in out over it
 *             (CHAT_LANDING_MS), then drop the stand-in — the real row is
 *             already at the destination, so the hand-over moves nothing,
 *             and the fade carries the words from the stand-in's rendering
 *             to the page's (see land()). The echo being gone before the real
 *             row mounts holds the stand-in where it is until a row is there.
 *
 * Five edges:
 *
 *   Hide in the same frame   the observer's callback runs before this frame
 *                            paints, so the real row is never shown for a frame;
 *                            a frame later the reader sees a normal bubble
 *                            flash and then be wiped.
 *   Notice outside the frame  "at once" is not "every frame": the echo being
 *                            swapped for the real row is recognised
 *                            synchronously before this frame paints, and asking
 *                            again in the frame is wasted work.
 *   No origin, no flight     when the origin cannot be captured (a keyboard
 *                            shortcut, a programmatic submission) nothing is
 *                            done and the reader sees the host's own behaviour.
 *   Hidden must be returned  while the real row is hidden the reader cannot see
 *                            that message, so besides the normal landing there
 *                            is a timer as a backstop: rAF stops in a hidden
 *                            tab, the stand-in stops, and the mark must not stay.
 *   One screen only          with either end off screen the stand-in would
 *                            vanish at the edge and the message would look like
 *                            it appeared out of nothing, so it does not fly.
 * @returns teardown: the listeners go, and a flight in progress — a hidden
