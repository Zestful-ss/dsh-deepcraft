/**
 * Where a heat cell's tip pill stands.
 *
 * The pill is centred on its cell (home-overview.css), so it hangs half its own
 * width past either side of it: a cell within that reach of the grid's own edge
 * carries the pill over the panel's edge, and the panel — a scroll container —
 * answers with a horizontal scrollbar under the grid. Which cells are within
 * reach is the pill's own width, and that changes with the day written on it and
 * the figure beside it, so the cell the pointer is on says it: the pill is
 * generated only while that cell is hovered, and its used width is readable
 * from there.
 *
 * The pill also stands twice a cell tall, so a cell in the grid's upper rows
 * carries it over the grid's own top edge and across the panel's stat cells
 * above. The side is the cell's own too: the pill stands on whichever side of
 * the cell holds more room, above when the two are equal, and its height is
 * read off the same generated pill as the width.
 *
 * The answers are written on the cell as `data-edge` and `data-side`, which the
 * stylesheet reads: `start` lines the pill up with the cell's left edge, `end`
 * with its right, neither is the centred pill that already fits, and `below`
 * hangs the pill under the cell.
