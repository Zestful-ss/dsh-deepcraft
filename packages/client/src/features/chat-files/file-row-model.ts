/**
 * The file-operation row's derivations, kept apart from its React component
 * (chat-files.ts): what a write or edit call is, which diff it shows, and how
 * a path or a failure reads.
 *
 * The host's own file row draws a diff card for a root call only — its
 * diff-card-model returns null the moment a block carries a parentCallId —
 * so the `+96 -0` tail appears on a directly called write or edit and not on
 * the sub-calls run_code dispatches. The skin wants exactly that other half,
 * so it derives the same model without that exclusion. The cost is stated
 * plainly: a sub-call persists no presentation metadata, so after it settles
 * there is nothing saying what was applied and only the arguments can speak —
 * a write's argument is the whole content (exact), an edit's is that pair of
 * replacements (which `replace_all`, or a write that failed, can put out of
 * step with what really happened). A read's window is therefore taken twice:
 * from the call's own metadata where it has any, which is a root call, and
 * otherwise read back out of the model-facing envelope the read tool writes,
 * which is what a sub-call leaves behind; a text that is neither falls back to
 * the skin's IN/OUT card.
 *
 * The three operations take the host's own row through the keyed seat
 * `tool.call.toolview` under the keys `read`, `edit` and `write`, registered
 * and released together, so every file operation draws in the skin's row.
 *
 * Within one process group the same file's calls read as one row, headed by the
 * earliest call still mounted (file-row-merge.ts keeps the registry). A
 * registration is keyed by call id because the host hands one row element to
 * the file's next call: keyed by element, a read would zero a tail another call
 * wrote. The flipping digits clip with `clip-path`, since `overflow` would move
 * the inline-block's baseline and lift the glyphs. A host that draws one row
 * per file itself replaces this model.
