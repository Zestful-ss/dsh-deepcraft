 * The file row's read-across-calls half: the calls that touched one file

 *
 * The host renders one row per call and hands each of them only its own block,
 * so a row that has to know what the others did reads it here: every row
 * registers the file it touched, the operation it performed and what its own
 * call changed, and the row the registry names as the group's head draws the
 * whole file's tail, its whole diff card and the operation the file's work last
 * reached. A file touched once is drawn exactly as it was before this module
 * existed.
 *
 * A group is one process group's content layer (D3), so two pieces of work in
 * one turn are never read together, and the head is the group's earliest call
 * in document order: a number that grows stays where the file was first
 * touched, and the operation it wears moves on in place. The calls a program
 * dispatched are the case with several rows of one file on the page at once:
 * the host renders them side by side under the program's own row, inside the
 * same content layer.
