/**
 * The one row this feature draws itself (D72): the caret's two answers as
 * preview cards. The same line is typed out in both, character by character,
 * with the caret following it — the on card's caret glides to each new place
 * the way the drawn one does, the off card's arrives there at once the way the
 * host's own caret does (features/caret/caret.css). The caret is lit for the
 * whole time the line is being typed and blinks on the native cycle once the
 * line stands whole: the drawn caret restarts its blink on every move
 * (features/caret/caret.ts), so a reader who is typing never sees it dark.
 *
 * Both cards carry the same line in the same box, so the first card's measure of
 * the last typed character's edge places both carets; the bar's rule reads it as
 * `--dsh-deepcraft-caret-x` (features/settings/settings-cards.css).
