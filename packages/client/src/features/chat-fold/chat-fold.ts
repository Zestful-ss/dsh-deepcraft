/**
 * The chat area's folding, ported from dsh-chat-ux: a thinking row stays open
 * while the model reasons and folds back once it stops (reasoning-fold.ts), a
 * process group opens while its section runs and folds back when it ends
 * (process-fold.ts), a message the reader sent is clamped under a cap while the
 * skin's own toggle under it hands the whole message back (message-fold.ts), a
 * reader's own press on a row rolls the body down or up instead of snapping it
 * (fold-glide.ts), a process group's header counts what the group holds
 * (process-summary.ts), and a running reasoning plays back inside a window that
 * steps up as it streams (reasoning-stream.ts). All of them ride the one
 * preference: it means "the skin may fold the chat area", so off leaves the
 * automatic folding, the door, the header's words, the reasoning's window and
 * the reader's own folded messages to the host.
 *
 * The door takes over the reader's clicks on a folding row, a takeover of the
 * host's interface like any other (D72): the entry installs this only while
 * the preference is on and dsh-chat-ux is off the page (the manifest), and
 * this teardown leaves the clicks alone again. The follow guard asks whether
 * a door is rolling through `ui.chatFold`, which exists only while installed.
