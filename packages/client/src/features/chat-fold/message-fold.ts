/**
 * Fold a message the reader sent that is taller than the conversation can spare.
 *
 * The host renders a user message whole however long it is: a pasted trace or a
 * log dump stands in the column at its full height and pushes the rest of the
 * conversation away. Nothing in the host's markup offers a fold, so the skin
 * folds it — the bubble is clamped to the stylesheet's cap with its bottom edge
 * softened, and the skin's own toggle under it hands the whole message back. The
 * mark and the toggle are the skin's; the bubble, its words and the actions
 * beside it stay the host's.
 *
 * Both faces of a sent message are folded: the echo the host mounts the moment
 * the message goes out, and the durable row that replaces it. The reader sees
 * his message clamped as soon as it lands, not once the turn is over: the echo
 * is folded in the batch that mounts it rather than in the pass after, because
 * the send flight takes the bubble's box at take-off and carries its stand-in to
 * that box for the whole animation (chat-send/send-flight.ts).
 *
 * A message the reader opened stays open while its node stands — the choice is
 * kept per bubble, and every later pass re-applies it.
 *
 * The cap and the fade are the stylesheet's, read back off the bubble
 * (message-fold.css), so the threshold and the clamp are one number. A bubble is
 * read the first time it is seen and again whenever its own box moves: a row can
 * arrive before its own text has its final height.
