/**
 * The room the reasoning-effort trigger reserves beside the model trigger.
 *
 * The effort trigger is mounted on the body and pinned from the model trigger's
 * box, so the picker reserves its own width on that trigger's right edge — a
 * margin, which shifts the model trigger's label left and leaves the trigger
 * standing in the space the label gave up. A margin makes the row wider, and a
 * row with slack absorbs that; one without — the window narrowed, a long model
 * name — is pushed past the card's edge by it, which is the row's horizontal
 * scrollbar and a trigger pinned from a box outside the card.
 *
 * So the row is asked first: where its content no longer fits, the model name
 * gives up exactly the overflow. Its cap and the margin together leave the row
 * the width it had, and the name takes the truncation a narrow card already
 * asks of it. The cap has to come off for the name's own width to be read, so
 * this runs where the seat settles — a new label, a viewport or card change —
 * and the passes between keep what it found.
