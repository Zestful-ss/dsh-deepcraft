/**
 * Who has this page instead of the theme (D74): a skin, or ds-bot's Bot
 * surface. Null leaves the page to the theme.
 *
 * The skin center stamps `html[data-dsh-skin]` while a skin is painting, and
 * injects it into the served document, so that answer holds from the first
 * frame. It does not stamp its attribute for this theme's own row: selecting
 * this theme means the page has no skin on it, which is what leaves the page
 * free for the theme to take. A wallpaper plugin is not an owner: it paints
 * behind the shell, and the theme shares the page with it.
 *
 * ds-bot paints its whole Bot surface over the shell and withdraws it for the
 * shell's own interface in its Agent mode; its shell group marks `<body>`
 * while it is painted. Its browser half runs after this theme's, so until its
 * registry is on `window` the mode it saved answers instead, and a page that
 * reopens on the Bot surface never shows the theme first.
