/**
 * One line of words that swaps in place, after transitions.dev's "Text states
 * swap" (MIT), by way of its "Thinking states" composition: the wording leaving
 * rises out through a small blur, the wording arriving comes up from below while
 * the one leaving is still on its way out — the arriving copy stands parked and
 * is released one gap after the leaving one started — and the box neither
 * resizes nor jumps mid-swap.
 *
 * The box's width belongs to a hidden sizer, which is the recipe's own answer to
 * the problem the swap would otherwise cause: the copies are absolutely
 * positioned, so a box that held only what is moving would read as empty for the
 * length of a swap and throw everything laid out beside it to the left edge and
 * back. The sizer holds every word a swap puts in the box while it runs, laid
 * over each other, and comes down onto the words standing the moment it settles
 * — so two states of different lengths never leave the clock beside the line
 * stranded after words that are no longer that long. Each of those two widths
 * is a move rather than a jump: the box is pinned at the width it stands at,
 * written with the one it heads for, and the stylesheet's transition carries it
 * there (shared/swapping-text.css), so the clock beside the line travels with
 * it instead of being displaced twice per wording.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the layout (D40). The words arrive in some feature's write
 * phase, and a box read there or in any frame's read phase forces the page's
 * style and layout ahead of the render, which on a long conversation costs more
 * than the frame. The sizer's width is heard instead, through the observation
 * bus, from the layout the render makes anyway; the box is pinned at the width
 * last heard, which is the width it stands at. Whatever has to start from a
 * committed pose — the box travelling off its pin, the copies leaving their
 * start poses — is written in a frame after the render that laid it out.
 *
 * The names, the blurs and the distance are the recipe's, carried as this
 * skin's own properties; shared/swapping-text.css reads them. The reader's
 * animation choice (D40) decides at call time whether any of it runs, instead
 * of the recipe's own media query — core/prefs.ts has already resolved the
 * setting and the system preference into one answer.
