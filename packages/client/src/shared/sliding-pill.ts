/**
 * The sliding highlight of a segmented control: one pseudo-element on the
 * control (shared/sliding-pill.css) that travels to the active item,
 * instead of each item fading its own background out and the next one in.
 * Every segmented control in the skin places it through this one factory, so
 * they share one feel.
 *
 * The attribute and the first placement land in the same call: the
 * pseudo-element does not exist before it, so the pill appears in place and
 * only later moves slide. The whole box is measured, so a control that wraps
 * onto two lines still lands the pill on the item's own line. Font loading
 * changes widths with no DOM mutation, hence the ResizeObserver. Reduced
 * motion does not stop the slide; the movement is required of the control.
 *
 * @param activeSelector - the active item, relative to the control.
 * @returns `{ measure(control), sync(control), release() }`: `measure` takes
 *   the reading in the pass's read phase and `sync` places the pill from it in
 *   the write phase; a `sync` whose pass took no reading measures then, which
 *   is what a control built during the write phase needs. A different control
 *   takes the placement off the previous one, null just takes it off;
 *   `release` takes it off and stops watching.
