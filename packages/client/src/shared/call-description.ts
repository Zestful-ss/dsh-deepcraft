/**
 * The words a call in flight declares for itself (features/chat-wait): the
 * host's shell tools (pwsh, bash) take a required `description` argument —
 * what the command does, in the model's own words — and the host's own tool
 * row shows it beside the tool's title. The waiting line carries it the way it
 * carries a reasoning clause (shared/activity-phrase): the first line as the
 * model wrote it, whole, so the row's own width decides how much of it shows.
 * Only a started call is read: a preparing one's argument JSON is cut off
 * mid-stream (shared/file-tool).
