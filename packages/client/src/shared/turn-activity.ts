 * under, and the feature that draws the line reads that key through its own
 * copy. Three states are not copy, and the `precise` choice decides whether the
 * line reads them at all: the file a call in flight works on
 * (shared/file-tool), which fills the copy's `{file}` slot, the description a
 * command call declares for itself (shared/call-description), and the clause
 * the model's own reasoning says it is on (shared/activity-phrase). The last
 * two are the model's text as it wrote it and carry no copy key. The simple
 * choice reads none of them: every state is its bare copy.
