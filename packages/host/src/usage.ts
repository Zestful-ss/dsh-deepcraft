/**
 * The usage aggregation service the `usage` route reads, and the pass that fills
 * it.
 *
 * The dashboard needs cross-session token totals bucketed by day, which no host
 * service publishes: the `tokenUsage` projection is per session and the session
 * list carries only that session's own totals. This module owns the pass and the
 * state; the four parts below own the sources and the shapes:
 *
 *   - `usage-ledger.ts` reads the cost-meter plugin's ledger, read-only, and
 *     declares the bucket shapes. Its days are the whole history the cost meter
 *     saw, every provider included.
 *   - `usage-fold.ts` finds the session logs and folds them, which is what covers
 *     the dates past the ledger's newest day.
 *   - `usage-record.ts` keeps each session's fold: the account that outlives the
 *     log, so a deleted session keeps its days.
 *   - `usage-summary.ts` merges the two accounts by date, and shapes the payload.
 *
 * The two accounts are combined, never added: both describe the same days, so a
 * day the ledger knows stays the ledger's and the fold answers only for the days
 * past its newest one. A ledger that answers is published before the fold starts,
 * so a ledger the cost meter stopped updating still shows its days at once.
 * `totals.sessions` can count a session twice when it spans a ledger day and a
 * folded one: the two sources name sessions in different shapes.
 *
 * A host that publishes cross-session usage totals, or keeps the usage of deleted
 * sessions, retires the matching path here.
