 * carrying its id (`removeOwnedStyles`). A sibling that mounts its sheet from

 * package's next reload, stripping the sibling's rules off a page that keeps
 * running. Every untagged sheet that is not this package's own is therefore
 * parked under a resting tag: the tag carries a slash, can never equal a package
 * name, and matches no removal step, so the sibling keeps its sheet — and its
 * own teardown still removes that sheet by reference when its generation ends.
