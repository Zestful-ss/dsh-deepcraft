/**
 * The host contract as one table (D3): the literals in packages/contracts/src/dom.ts,
 * each with what the skin reads it for and how the contract test checks it on
 * a live host (D66).
 *
 * The table is build and test data rather than runtime data: the browser bundle
 * carries the literals alone, so the notes cost the page nothing. The build
 * holds the two lists together — every exported literal of the DOM contract has
 * to appear here, and every id has to be named by a feature manifest (D72) — so
 * a selector cannot enter the skin without a note and an owner, and a host
 * upgrade can be audited from this list alone.
 *
 * The host build these entries were checked on is the one the service shapes
 * name (packages/contracts/src/services.ts, 0.2.1-alpha.1), and the lane's
 * `contract` scenario walks every `probe` below against a live host (D3, D66).
