/**
 * smoke.cjs — zero-dependency smoke test of the BUILT plugin (`lib/`); no running
 * DSH instance is needed.
 *
 * Host half, in Node: `lib/host/index.js` is applied to a fake cordis context and the
 * username and session-delete routes get the request shapes that matter
 * (D75) — a cross-site page, a LAN peer and the browser's
 * own same-origin fetch, plus the deletion route's own guards (POST only, a
 * path-shaped id, an id carrying the escape itself, an open session) and a real
 * deletion against a scratch harness home under .debug/, including a
 * plugin-generated id stored under the harness's escaped name — once through a
 * host that offers
 * `connection.requestRejection()` and once through the local stand-in. The
 * public prefix route serves the assets the build routed from lib/assets/,
 * under the build's own manifest, and nothing else.
 *
 * Browser half, in headless Chrome/Edge through Playwright (packages/testing/browser.cjs):
 * `lib/client.js` is loaded into
 * a page that stands in for the host (module loader, ctx, a sidebar footer with
 * an account menu and two plugin entries, a composer whose editor handles Enter
 * the way the host's keymap does), and checked for:
 *   - boot       apply() installs every feature and registers its teardown;
 *   - idle       once settled, no scheduler pass runs — a pass that mutates the
 *                DOM schedules the next one, and then the page never idles;
 *   - enter      Enter on an open composer menu reaches the host, never "Send";
 *   - popovers   the shared popover rule: a pointer crossing a trigger opens
 *                nothing before the dwell elapses, and whichever card opens last
 *                folds the one before it — the skin's own cards and the host's
 *                hero menu alike;
 *   - desktop    the 0.1.7 desktop footer: the host's own account row is the
 *                entry, and our container is injected into its account menu —
 *                first child, self-healing across a host re-render, reachable
 *                by the host's keyboard walk, and gone when the menu closes;
 *   - markup     strings from settings, the account service and plugins render
 *                as text, never as markup;
 *   - isolation  a host API that breaks one feature — at install or at sync —
 *                retires only that feature and hands its surface back (D12);
 *   - deepy      the DeepSeek brand: the whale stands on the home card and on
 *                the conversation's input area (or the panel replacing its
 *                card), follows the session's state and moments, changes
 *                frames without waking a pass, and leaves with the page;
 *   - teardown   dispose leaves no skin node, marker, body attribute or
 *                stylesheet behind, and no pass runs afterwards.
 *
 * This file is the runner. The parts live in packages/testing/smoke/: shared.cjs (paths,
 * fixtures, `check`), host-half.cjs (the Node half), page.cjs (one case's
 * stand-in page), the stand-in/ and probe/ parts (the scripts that page runs
 * before and after the bundle) and cases.cjs (what each case's report must show).
 *
 * Usage: node packages/testing/smoke.cjs [--case <name>[,<name>…]] [--feature <dir>[,<dir>…]] [--quick] [--jobs <n>]
 *        (CHROME_PATH overrides the browser lookup, DSH_SMOKE_JOBS the page count)
 *        --case runs the named browser cases alone, --feature the cases that
 *        cover the named directories under packages/client/src/features/; both may be repeated,
 *        combined, and neither means every case. --quick leaves out the cases
 *        and the checks that watch motion (TIMING_CASES in packages/testing/smoke/
 *        shared.cjs). Cases that share a stand-in configuration and a markup
 *        run in one page load (PAGES in shared.cjs), and the log names the pages
 *        it loaded. The pages are independent of one another — each carries its
 *        own context, markup and probe — so they are driven several at a time
 *        (JOBS below, `--jobs` or DSH_SMOKE_JOBS to change it) and the pages
 *        that watch motion run two at a time at the end, over a quiet browser.
 *        The Node host half runs either way.
 * Exit:  0 every check passed · 1 a check failed · 2 the browser half could not run
