 * Markdown resolves, every decision a comment or a document cites exists
 * (numbers are stable and a retired one stays citable), every repository path
 * prose names exists, no feature module reaches past the handles its manifest
 * declares (D72), and no pair of files holds a copied stretch (jscpd).

// packages/testing/document-lookups.json with the reason it is still there: a
// file's count has to match its entry, and an entry whose count reaches zero
// comes out of the file. That the record's total never rises is held against
// the base by scripts/ci-scope.mjs --ledgers. A unit test stands outside the
// rule: its document runs in the test browser and costs no reader anything.
